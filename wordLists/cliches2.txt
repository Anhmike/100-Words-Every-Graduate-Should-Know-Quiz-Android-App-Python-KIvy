As many Chins as a Chinese phone book	
As plain as the nose on your face	
As snug as a bug in a rug, To be	
As tender as a mother's heart	
As the crow flies	
As useful as a lead balloon	
As useful as tits on a bull	
As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party	
As ye sow, so shall ye reap	
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust	
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies	
Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country	
Asleep at the wheel
